# Getting Started

This is a cool little game to play in the browser.\
It uses Typescript for the frontend, as well as Redux & its sagas.\
Backend was kept to minimum to focus on frontend development.\
Total development from start to finish is 25 hours including a little sleep.

## Available Scripts for FRONTEND

In the `/frontend` directory, you should focus on:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode USING PORT 3000.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
\
It uses react-scripts test behind the scenes so no need to run jest.


## Available Scripts for BACKEND

In the `/backend` directory, you should focus on:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode USING PORT 8080.
App will restart on each file change.

### `npm test`
